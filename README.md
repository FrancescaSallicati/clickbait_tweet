This repository consist in a clickbait detector model buil on Webis-Clickbait dataset. The implementation is organized in the following folders: <br />
* data --> contains the training and test datasets <br />
* notebooks --> analysis, model training and evaluation notebooks. Models are originally saved in 'trained_models' and a csv is generated updating the metrics results table, however only the best model is uploaded to this repository <br />
* src --> useful scripts for training, evaluation, analysis, etc <br />
* trained_models --> checkpoints and vocabularies for the best model <br />


## Instructions

### Environment

conda activate clickbait_detection
```

### Jupyter Notebook

To be able to use the environment in Jupyter Notebook run the following commands:

```bash
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=clickbait_detection
```

### Git LFS

Data and models are uploaded with git-lfs.  <br />
From the root directory of this repo, run the following command to make sure that they are dowloaded:
